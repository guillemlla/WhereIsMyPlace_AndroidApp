With the app you will be able to request the data of a server database that has the information of every place in the library. We obtain it with intel edison and a ultrasonic distance mesure.

Also, you will be able to identify yourseld as a user with you university card and a RDFI reader. So you will have all the data of your hours of studing and also locate your friends if they are in the library
